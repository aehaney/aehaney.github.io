    <p>Well, it’s official.  This website is up and going and so that is something worth being proud of (right?).</p>

<p>These past few weeks have been a huge learning curve.  I came into this class with virtually no experience with command lines, HTML, Markdown, or anything like these.  I was extremely nervous when I started going over the syllabus.  I thought to myself, “I have to build my own website??” It sounded horrifying!  But before I even realized it, I was being equipped with the tools necessary to do just this!</p>

<p>We started off learning the command line.  We practiced basic things like <code class="highlighter-rouge">pwd</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code>. These were basic things that taught us how to navigate.</p>

<p>More recently we’ve moved on to learning how to use Git as our version control system all working in a Github repository.  These things sounded extremely (and I mean EXTREMELY) intimading and difficult.  That overwhelmed feeling I had at the beginning of the semester?  Well, let’s just say it came back.</p>

<p>Honestly, though, I’m confident that whatever happens, I’m going to be okay.  I’m recognizing that this is all a trial and error process.  The best thing about the requirements of this class are that you learn through hands-on learning.</p>

<p>I think what I’ll start off sharing for my website is how I created it!</p>

<p>First, I selected by layout (I chose to use the Gravity theme) and cloned it into a new Cloud 9 workspace.  I then pushed it into my own repository. Part of this process also involved running <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve --host $IP --port $PORT</code>.  From there, while in my Cloud 9 workspace, I opened <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> and changed the base url to the appropriate url with my github username.  After all of that, I followed a few steps to crate this post!</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd Gravity
cd _posts
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then I created a new post which I named 2016-09-24-first-blog-post.markdown.  I opened up the blog post, filled out the content that you’re seeing here and saved it.  After that, I typed the following in my terminal:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>git status
git add .
git commit -m "Inserted relevant content with reflection on class so far"
git push
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I filled out the appropriate information and the information was available on the website like you are seeing now.</p>

<p>It always feels good to have little successes like this.  It’s those moments where I’m convinced these things are way too over my head for me to be successful, yet I find myself being successful, that mean the most.</p>

<p>It will definitely take more practice, but I’m feeling confident about the path that I’m on.</p>

<p>In the mean time, here’s a cute puppy and my cat Zelda celebrating the creation of this website!</p>
