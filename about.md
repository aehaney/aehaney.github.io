On August 14th of this year, I got married!  I married my best friend in the whole world.  We're both seniors at UNC Chapel Hill and ready to graduate.  

One of the silly parts of the semester is that I haven't yet changed my name with the university.  So while I'm signing all documentation as Amanda Ulrich, because that's now legally my name, I'm still referred to and completing assignments as Amanda Haney.

Have I mentioned how lucky men are that they don't ever have to change their name?  #patriarchy

This summer I interned at MetLife GTO.  As a political science major, I was the only liberal arts major at the internship.  Most students were technical degrees, though others were business degrees.  For awhile I definitely felt out of place with my degree, but eventually I was able to realize the valuea  liberal arts degree can bring to the technical field.

I've won 2 hula hooping competitions!

Althogh they weren't serious competitions, I still hold my title as hula hooping champion with great pride.
