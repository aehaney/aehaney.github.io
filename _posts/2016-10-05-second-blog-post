So I wanted to take some time and reflect some more on what has happened.

Right now, I'm realizing that this is really, really hard.  Shout out to every single person who does this stuff for a living.  It's been extremely challenging, but I'm confident things are going to be better.

With the project being due extremely soon, I'm hoping all will go well.  I haven't been quite as advanced as others in terms of adding sparkles and such, but I'm confident that with time and trial and error I'll definitely get there.
