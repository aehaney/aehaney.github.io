Well, it's official.  This website is up and going and so that is something worth being proud of (right?).

For my first post, I'm going to reflect on what I've done so far in class.

I started by learning a lot about the different commands such as 

`pwd`, `ls`, and `cd`.

Those were all the initial first steps.  After that, we moved forward with learning different git commands.

The git commands have not been too difficult.  I feel like what I've had the most trouble with is just remembering exactly how to spell things out.  For instance, it can be easy to remember to put the `-m` when I'm commiting a post.  But little things like that will come with practice and will eventually be muscle memory.

I think what I really need help with is highlighting.  I've consistantly tried to add highlights to this blog post and it continues to not seem to work.
