Well, it's official.  This website is up and going and so that is something worth being proud of (right?).

For my first post, I thought I would give one of my favorite recipes.  The funny thing about me is I hate to cook, but I love to bake.  I'm not entirely sure why this is or where it comes from.  My theory is that baking is easy because it has simple, easy to follow instructions.  Cooking is harder, though.  There's more room for error.  I love how baking gives me the tools to create something, but I get admittedly nervous about cooking because my creativity seems to consistantly lead to a less-than-appetizing end product. But now I'm going to put my best apron foward and show you one of my favorite recipes of all time:

Classic Coffee Cake.

The great thing about this coffee cake is that you it's healthy AND fast.  So it's perfect to satisfy anyone's sweet tooth!

Ingredients: 

1 1/2 T coconut flour (can sub for all almond flour)
1 T almond flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
1-2 T granulated sweetener of choice (adjust to desired sweetness)
Pinch cinnamon
Pinch nutmeg
1/2 tsp almond extract
1 large egg white (for a vegan version, use 1 flax egg)*
1 T- 1/4 cup dairy free milk of choice**


What to do:  

1) In a small bowl, combine the dry ingredients and mix well.
2) In a separate small bowl, combine the almond extract, dairy free milk and the egg white (or flax egg) and whisk lightly. Add the mixture to the dry mixture and mix until just combined.
3) If using the streusel topping, in a small bowl, combine the almond flour with the cinnamon and palm sugar and mix well. Add the almond butter and mix well until a thick, crumbly mixture is produced. Add a dash of dairy free milk if desired.
4) Grease a large mug or deep bowl (I used a cereal bowl) generously and pour the batter in it and microwave for 50 seconds-2 minutes (Depending on brand and wattage).
5) Enjoy!!!

Until next time,
