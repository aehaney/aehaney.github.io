Well, it's official.  This website is up and going and so that is something worth being proud of (right?).

For my first post, I'm going to reflect on what I've done so far in class.

I started by learning a lot about the different commands such as 

{% highlight bash %}
`pwd`, `ls`, and `cd`.
{% end highlight%}

Those were all the initial first steps.  After that, we moved forward with learning different git commands.
