The funny thing about me is that I hate to cook, but I love to bake.  I'm not entirely sure why that is, but my theory is that baking is easy because it has simple, easy to follow instructions.  Cooking, on the other hand, is not quite so easy.  There's more room for error.  I love how baking gives me the tools to create something, but I feel safe under the structure of the receipe.  I  admittedly get nervous about cooking because my creativity seems to consistantly lead to a less-than-appetizing end product. But now I'm going to put my best apron foward and show you one of my favorite recipes of all time:
